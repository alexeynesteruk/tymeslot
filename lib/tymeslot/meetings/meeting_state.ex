  @moduledoc """
  Single owner of predicates derived from a meeting's two independent state
  axes: `status` (the booking lifecycle — pending, awaiting_payment,
  confirmed, cancelled, completed) and `reschedule_requested_at` (whether the
  organizer is currently awaiting the attendee to pick a new time). The two
  axes are orthogonal: an organizer reschedule request no longer overwrites
  `status`, so a `pending` or `awaiting_payment` meeting keeps that status
  while a request is pending.

  `status == "reschedule_requested"` is a legacy value: no code writes it any
  more, but it remains a valid enum member so historical (or unmigrated) rows
  keep reading correctly here.

  Whether a provider calendar event should still exist for this meeting.
  Answers a different question from `active?/1` and `slot_void?/1`: `active?`
  is "may a user interact with it", `slot_void?` is "does its time slot
  still hold", and this is "should we expect a provider event on the
  organizer's calendar right now". A meeting can be active yet have a void
  slot (an organizer reschedule request pending, or the legacy
  `"reschedule_requested"` status) — in that case we deliberately deleted or
  never created the provider event, so its absence must never be treated as
  an external deletion.

  Callers reconciling calendar state against provider signals (e.g.
  deciding whether a missing event implies an external deletion) must use
  this predicate, not `active?/1`.
